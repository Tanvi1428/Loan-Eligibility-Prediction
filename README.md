# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
Loan eligibility prediction is a data-driven approach to evaluate an applicant's suitability for a loan by analyzing multiple factors such as income, credit history, employment type, loan amount, and repayment ability. Using machine learning models like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, the system can classify whether an applicant is eligible for a loan.
